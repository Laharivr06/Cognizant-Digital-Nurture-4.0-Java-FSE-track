1. Inventory Management System
Principle: Choose the most appropriate data structure to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.
Use Case: Using ArrayList or HashMap to manage products in a warehouse inventory.
Benefit: Improves the speed of operations like add, update, delete, and supports scalability for large datasets.

2. E-commerce Platform Search Function
Principle: Apply optimal search algorithms based on data characteristics and structure.
Use Case: Searching product names using linear search (unsorted) or binary search (sorted).
Benefit: Binary search provides faster lookup (O(log n)) when data is sorted, improving user experience.

3. Sorting Customer Orders
Principle: Select efficient sorting algorithms based on performance needs and input size.
Use Case: Sorting customer orders by total price using Bubble Sort and Quick Sort.
Benefit: Quick Sort is preferred for large datasets due to its average-case efficiency (O(n log n)).

4. Employee Management System
Principle: Use basic data structures like arrays to manage structured records with predictable size.
Use Case: Storing and managing employees using a fixed-size array.
Benefit: Provides fast access (O(1)), though limited by static size and costly deletion (O(n)).

5. Task Management System
Principle: Leverage dynamic data structures like linked lists for flexible data handling.
Use Case: Managing tasks using a singly linked list for operations like add, delete, and traverse.
Benefit: Supports dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion without shifting elements.

6. Library Management System
Principle: Apply appropriate search strategies based on data ordering and access patterns.
Use Case: Searching for books by title using linear or binary search based on sorted order.
Benefit: Adapts to both small unsorted datasets (linear) and large sorted datasets (binary) effectively.

7. Financial Forecasting
Principle: Use recursive algorithms with optimization techniques like memoization for repeated computation.
Use Case: Calculating future value predictions using recursion.
Benefit: Simplifies problem solving and avoids redundant calls using memoization, improving efficiency from exponential to linear time.
